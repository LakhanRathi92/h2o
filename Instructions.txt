Install OpenSSL (version >= 1.0.2) for windows. May be from here http://www.heise.de/download/product/win32-openssl-47316
Download Zlib: http://www.zlib.net/. 

To run libh2o examples or unit tests:

a) Run cmake and provide path for LibUV include and library directories, same for zlib.
b) Generate the solution.


1)  Running Tests (t-00unit-libuv.t):
	1.1)	
	Put folder with name "t" in the Build directory, if you have generated solution in a different folder than source.
	1.2)
	Link the test project with external library you generated for mman.
	1.3) 
	Copy libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll and put them in your Build folder. (Can be found in 
	openSSL/bin directory). 
	1.4) 
	Build and Debug.

2)  examples-simple : serves a static file over http.
	2.1) 
    In Visual studio 2015, right click on examples-simple->properties.
    Go to linker, Input, additional dependencies, and provide path of mman.lib, that you can build
	from source code provided in Externallibararies_MSVC folder.

    2.2)
	Copy libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll and put them in your Build folder. (Can be found in 
	openSSL/bin directory), also if cmake build directory is different from source folder, copy examples folder in build directory.
	
	2.3) 
	Generate key.pem and certificate.pem for your webserver, and put them in your h2o build folder.
	"openssl req -x509 -newkey rsa:4096 -keyout key.pem -out cert.pem" .
	though encryption is not required for http2, but most browser only accept http2 with encryption.

USAGE:	
	The default address:port is: https//localhost:7890/index.html, you can request from any http2 compliant browser.

	
3) examples-http1client
   3.1) same as 2.1) 

USAGE:
	from console : examples-http1client.exe URL
	or Right click on examples-http1client, properties, debugging, and provide URL as command
	argument.
	URL: http//
	Make sure libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll are present in Debug directory.
